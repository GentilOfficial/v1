## 🔍 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this project.

    .
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── README.md
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── tailwind.config.js

1.  **`/public`**: This directory will contain the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to set the page title.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template.

3. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

4. **`package-lock.json`**: This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project.

5. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

6.  **`tailwind.config.js`**: This file is where you configure the paths to all of your HTML templates, JavaScript components, and any other source files that contain Tailwind class names.
